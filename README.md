# Hangman Game

This project is a simple beginner level python project. Hangman is a guessing game for 2 players, where one player thinks of a word, sentence or phrase and the other player tries to guess it letter by letter upto an allowed number of wrong letter guesses. If any of the guessed letters do not exist in the word, sentence or phrase chosen by player 1 then a the number of guesses remaining reduces by one. The game ends if either player 2 successfully guesses the game, or all the wrong guesses counts reach zero and player 2 is said to have lost the game.
